## **Background**

The recent outbreak of Coronavirus in China has all the Chinese people in home. Instead of celebrating lunar new year in a traditional way with familier and friends, people are grounded at home and banned all travels out side their city.  Millions of People change the focus to the social media platform, mainly Weibo, to exchange information about the Coronavirus, to post their view of government respones to the crisis and to record their life. 

Me and many other volunteer formed a group online to document these media pieces so that not only those stoires could be memories , but more importnatly, a corpus for further research in the field such as HCI, social media studies.

##### My Contribution

Having experience in fansubbing, I organized volunteers to translate the stories written in English, and help to build the github repo.

As we are still in the fighting with Coronavirus or COVID-19; the stories continue, and so do we.
